This is my attempt to put together some rails templates to speed up getting my apps off the ground.  

I hope that these templates will serve two purposes: 1) An evolving repository for my admidly weak understanding of rails best practices and 2) A means to speed up getting apps off the ground.  My rails foundation was laid by Michael Hartl's amazing [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) which has been added to by Ryan Bate's [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/), various folks writing in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and other generous souls scattered around the web.  I hope I cited specific sources in my comments.

Most recently I've started working my way through ["The Rails View"](http://pragprog.com/book/warv/the-rails-view) by John Athayde and Bruce Williams and indeed it was frustration with the inconvenience of recording notes on their book that inspired my detour into [Rails Templates](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html) in the first place.  As of 02012-Aug-21 I've only made it up to page 24 and have set it aside to get my basic template started.  What you see in app assets and views/layouts was inspired by the book.  They make their code available themselves [here.](http://pragprog.com/titles/warv/source_code)  Hopefully I'll to return to their book soon which will lead to even better and more complete view practices.  If you find the app assets stuff here useful, consider doing what I did and consider buying "The Rails View" book or e-version.  

# Usage

1) create new [GitHub](www.github.com) repository with name of your new app.  Note: After making repository on github, do not follow additional instructions for github deployment in the command line.  All that is automated in the template.

2) Create postgres database
in rails directory

    $ mkdir [new app name]
    $ cd [new app name]
    $ postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

3) In new tab:

    $ rails new [app name] -m [template file or url]

Note: I changed my default rails new generator to skip test unit and use postgresql with
`$ echo -d postgresql -T > ~/.railsrc`
So:
I don’t do this:  `$ rails new [app name] -d postgresql --skip-test-unit -m [template file]`
I use the following:

    $ rails new [app name] -m [template file or url]

eg

    $ rails new [app name] -m https://raw.github.com/BenU/rails-templates/master/main.rb

**TODO's Sept 17, 02012**
* Set up authentication, authorization
  - Review [can can](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for best (good enough) implimentation of roles.
  - solicit authentication attributes -- password reset, etc.
  - solicit user attributes +/- role(s)
  - set up for email with sendgrid
  - dynamically generate user/role model(s) and integration tests 
* Add nifty generator gem or role own scaffold generator
* Performant checklist - Remove unneeded aspects of rails, New Relic, chaching, sprites, t/c Blitz, Cloud Assault
* uptime checklist - Ranger
* error logging - Airbrake, Sentry, StatsMix, StillAlive
* SSL encryption
* Security checklist, brakeman, etc.  T/c Strong Parameters,  See [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) [Security Tools page](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/security_tools).
* Keep site up to date with SourceNinja
* See ThoughtBot "[The Playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/)" for more ideas on integrating best practices.
