This is my attempt to put together some rails templates to speed up getting my apps off the ground.  

I hope that these templates will serve two purposes: 1) An evolving repository for my admidly weak understanding of rails best practices and 2) A means to speed up getting apps off the ground.  My rails foundation was laid by Michael Hartl's amazing [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) which has been added to by Ryan Bate's [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/), various folks writing in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and other generous souls scattered around the web.  I hope I cited specific sources in my comments.

Most recently I've started working my way through ["The Rails View"](http://pragprog.com/book/warv/the-rails-view) by John Athayde and Bruce Williams and indeed it was frustration with the inconvenience of recording notes on their book that inspired my detour into [Rails Templates](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html) in the first place.  As of 02012-Aug-21 I've only made it up to page 24 and have set it aside to get my basic template started.  That said, what you see in app assets was inspired by the book and that currently isn't cited in my code.  I'll probably get to that soon enough but wanted to be explic at least here.  They make their code available themselves [here.](http://pragprog.com/titles/warv/source_code)  Hopefully I'll to return to their book soon which will lead to even better and more complete view practices and better citations.  If you find the app assets stuff here useful, consider doing what I did and consider buying "The Rails View" book or eversion.
